I realize this is very simple but it seems to work.
All we have to do is print what we want to be in the new terminal into
this .txt file and the run 
int exit_status = system("gnome-terminal -- tail -f output.txt");
which will open the new terminal and print whatever is in the file to it. 

The only downside is that I beleive this will open a new terminal every time 
it's executed. 
I couldn't find a way to have it just keep printing to the same terminal.
